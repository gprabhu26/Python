Notes - Create virtual environment

To know the python version in Linux:

	gprabhu14@gp:~$ python3 -V
	Python 3.8.10
	
Creating virtual evn using venv module:

	$ sudo apt install -y python3-venv
	
To create a dir and traverse:

	$ mkdir environments
	$ cd environments

Once you are in the directory where you would like the environments to live, you can create an environment by running the following command:

	$ python3 -m venv my_env

Essentially, pyvenv sets up a new directory that contains a few items which we can view with the ls command:

	$ ls my_env

	$ Output
	$ bin include lib lib64 pyvenv.cfg share

To activate:

	$ source my_env/bin/activate

After following these steps, your virtual environment is ready to use.


To create first program:
	To open command line editor:
	(demo01) gprabhu14@gp:~/demo01$ nano hello.py
	
	To run:
	(demo01) gprabhu14@gp:~/demo01$ python hello.py 
	
	Output:
	Hello, World!
